# zeta-DOM

**zeta-DOM** is a cutting-edge project designed to enhance accessibility and interactivity in web applications through advanced rendering techniques and efficient shader management. Leveraging the power of Rust and modern graphics libraries, zeta-DOM focuses on the integration of a conical hierarchical structure to optimize the processing of DOM elements, shader vertex data, and material properties for real-time applications.

## Features

- **Coarse Granular Compression**: Efficiently compresses shader vertex materials to enhance rendering performance.
- **Conic Tree Hierarchy**: Organizes frame data in a hierarchical structure for improved manageability and clarity.
- **Video Metrics Ingestion**: Ingests video metrics from a SQLite database for dynamic rendering based on real-time data.
- **Multi-modal Capabilities**: Integrates with various rendering backends, enabling flexible deployment across platforms.
